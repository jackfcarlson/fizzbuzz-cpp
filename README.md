        //If the number is a multiple of 3, it will print the number
      
      
        //followed by "fizz". If the number is a multiple of 5, then
      
      
        //it will print "buzz". If the number is a multiple of both
      
      
        //3 and 5, it will print "fizzbuzz". The main function will
      
      
        //print "complete" when it is complete.
